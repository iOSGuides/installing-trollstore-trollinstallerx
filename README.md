## What is TrollInstallerX?

TrollInstallerX is a universal TrollStore installer that is known for its reliability, ease of use, and speed. It can install TrollStore and its persistence helper on the latest devices in just a few seconds.

TrollInstallerX supports all devices running iOS 14.0 - 16.6.1, both arm64 and arm64e. Depending on the device and iOS version, it uses one of two methods to install TrollStore:

- **Direct Installation:** Using the kfd kernel exploit, along with the dmaFail PPL bypass on iOS 15.2+ arm64e devices, TrollInstallerX can directly install both TrollStore and its persistence helper onto the device without having to leave the installer. This method supports iOS 14.0 - 16.6.1 (arm64) and iOS 14.0 - 16.5.1 (arm64e). However, A15, A16, and M2 devices on iOS 16.5.1 do not support this method, and A8 devices are only supported on iOS 14.0 - 15.1.

- **Indirect Installation:** Using the kfd kernel exploit, TrollInstallerX can replace a system application of your choice with the TrollStore persistence helper. This method is necessary due to the lack of a PPL bypass on iOS 16.6 and above, and the fact that dmaFail is non-functional on A15, A16, and M2 devices on iOS 16.5.1. This method supports iOS 16.5.1 - 16.6.1 (arm64e) and is the only method that supports A15, A16, and M2 devices on iOS 16.5.1.

Both methods allow the installation of a persistence helper into a removable system app. This is necessary because of the way the CoreTrust bug (used by TrollStore) works. In certain circumstances, TrollStore and other apps installed by it will be reset to User registration, instead of System. These apps cannot be opened until the persistence helper is used to set them back to System registration.

TrollInstallerX is a powerful tool that makes the installation of TrollStore a seamless process, regardless of the device or iOS version. Its versatility and efficiency make it an essential tool for all TrollStore users.

## How to Use TrollInstallerX

TrollInstallerX is a user-friendly universal TrollStore installer known for its speed, reliability, and simplicity. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide on how to use it:

1. **Download:** Download the latest release of TrollInstallerX from the official GitHub page.
2. **Sideload:** Sideload the downloaded file using your preferred method.
3. **Install:** Open the TrollInstallerX app and press the ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button. This will install TrollStore and/or its persistence helper onto your device.
4. **Choose an Exploit:** While TrollInstallerX automatically selects the best exploit for your device, you can choose a specific exploit if needed. To do this, open the settings view, select the desired exploit, and press the ‚ÄúInstall TrollStore‚Äù button. TrollInstallerX will then use the chosen exploit.

Please note that devices running iOS 16.2 - 16.6.1 and iOS 15.7.2 - 15.8.2 require an internet connection for TrollInstallerX to download the kernelcache and patchfind it.

With TrollInstallerX, installing TrollStore becomes a seamless process, making it an essential tool for all TrollStore users. Its ability to choose the best exploit for your device ensures a smooth and efficient installation process.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about TrollInstallerX

### Why does the ‚ÄúExploiting kernel‚Äù process get stuck?

This issue is often linked to the kfd exploit. A simple device reboot usually resolves it.

### Why can‚Äôt I access TrollStore after installing it successfully?

During the installation process, a persistence helper is also installed. If you can‚Äôt open TrollStore, launch your persistence helper and click on ‚Äúrefresh app registrations‚Äù.

### Why didn‚Äôt the app I chose become the persistence helper?

If the app you selected didn‚Äôt become the persistence helper, it‚Äôs likely that a persistence helper is already installed. Check which app is set as the persistence helper by opening TrollStore and navigating to settings.

### Why am I receiving a ‚Äúpatchfind‚Äù error?

This error could occur if:
- You‚Äôre using a version not supported by MacDirtyCow and you‚Äôre not connected to the internet, or;
- You‚Äôre using a Yellow iPhone 14 or Yellow iPhone 14 Plus on iOS 16.3 (20D50). In this case, you should open a GitHub Issue.

Note: If a file exists at /TrollInstallerX.app/kernelcache, TrollInstallerX will use that file instead of downloading the kernelcache. This is helpful if you have a slow or unreliable internet connection, or if your device and version combination doesn‚Äôt have a public kernelcache available.

### Why does TrollInstallerX say ‚Äúfailed to install persistence helper‚Äù when using the indirect method?

The indirect method isn‚Äôt foolproof and may sometimes fail to install the persistence helper. If this happens, restart your device and try again. If the same app continues to cause issues, consider using a different app.

### Why doesn‚Äôt TrollInstallerX support iOS 17.0?

TrollInstallerX doesn‚Äôt support iOS 17.0 as there are currently no public exploits available for it. Once an exploit is released, it will be incorporated into TrollInstallerX.
